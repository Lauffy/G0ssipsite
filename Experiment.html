      <p>In regards to viewing how gossip works within the example of the Steam Center, I wish to create a formal experiment on rumors and gossip in said location. The experiment will see how different pathways and the staff interact in regards to a variety of gossip. <br><br> The first concern that comes to mind is “Will anyone be negatively impacted by this”? To solve this problem, I will have individuals who are aware of this experiment. The people in this group will be the “Victims” and the “Gossiper”. The victims refer to the individual or individuals who have the gossip being spread about them (good or bad). The gossipers are first individuals to spread the gossip to either others in their pathway or other staff members. They will be tasked with speaking with as many individuals as they would deem to be normal and appropriate. This along with them not mentioning their role is done to maintain the sanctity of the experiment. The “victim” will be the one to determine what type of rumor they would be comfortable being spread about them. <br><br> The overall goal is that one negative and positive rumor would be said about the individual and a comparison would be made between how the two spread, how important they are deemed, and how well participants remember them. In regards to the participants, the main majority of the people partaking in this experiment will NOT be aware that it is happening.</p>
