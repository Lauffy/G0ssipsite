      <p class="col-sm-5">In regards to viewing how gossip works within the example of the Steam Center, I wish to create a formal experiment on rumors and gossip in said location. The experiment will see how different pathways and the staff interact in regards to a variety of gossip.</p>

    <p><br><br> The first concern that comes to mind is “Will anyone be negatively impacted by this”? To solve this problem, I will have individuals who are aware of this experiment. The people in this group will be the “Victims” and the “Gossiper”. The victims refer to the individual or individuals who have the gossip being spread about them (good or bad). The gossipers are first individuals to spread the gossip to either others in their pathway or other staff members. They will be tasked with speaking with as many individuals as they would deem to be normal and appropriate. This along with them not mentioning their role is done to maintain the sanctity of the experiment. The “victim” will be the one to determine what type of rumor they would be comfortable being spread about them. </p><br><br>

   <div class="row">
    <div class="pbody col-md-4" style="margin-bottom: 600px;">
      <p>The overall goal is that one negative and positive rumor would be said about the individual and a comparison would be made between how the two spread, how important they are deemed, and how well participants remember them. In regards to the participants, the main majority of the people partaking in this experiment will <b>NOT</b> be aware that it is happening.</p>

      <p>Negative Rumors(For Mr.Pryce)</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The reason Steam is called Steam is because while being high Mr.Pryce saw the vapors from a nearby hookah and thought to himself “This would make a good brand name”.</li>
        <li>Due to being the founder principal of Steam, Mr.Pryce made a clause in the contract for future principals that a portion of their salary must go to his family and future descendants.</li>
        <li>Mr.Pryce has attempted to get his doctorates 5 times and the last occasion of him defending his thesis ended with a plethora of offensive words being thrown arounds</li>
        <li>Mr.Pryce plans on leaving the Steam Center and has chosen to become the new principal of Thomas Edison High School.</li>
        <li>The superintendent and Mr.Pryce have a fling.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Positive Rumors(For Mr.Pryce)</p>
      <ol>
        <li>For the past 4 years Mr.Pryce donated 55% of his salary to the doctors without borders</li>
        <li>Mr.Pryce annually plans a secret “After Steam” trip or party to somewhere rather grandiose or regal</li>

      <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Gossip is the action, rumors are the effect</h3>
      <p>In order to collect this information, I passed out a form that allowed for individuals to give information on Gossip and those who participate in it. Due to the fact that the project is STEAM based, I also included questions that related how the different pathways are perceived in terms of gossip. In order to avoid bias in responses as well as possibly compromising the experiment, I didn't specify that the rumors were supposed to relate to Mr.Pryce. This allows for individuals to input any information they feel is relevant to the topic. If that happens to include the artificial topics that were spread at the beginning of the experiment, that will also be included into the general section of responses. I spoke to some of the individuals who are the primary gossipers midway during the experiment. Some noted that people were uninterested and had no concerned response about what was being said about Mr.Pryce while others were actively engaging in conversation about him</p>
