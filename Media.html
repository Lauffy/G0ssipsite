    <h1>What is Gossip?</h1>

    <p>
      Gossip is idle talk or rumour, especially about the personal or private affairs of others; the act is also known
      as dishing or tattling.<br><br>

      Gossip is a topic of research in evolutionary psychology, which has found gossip to be an important means for
      people to monitor cooperative reputations and so maintain widespread indirect reciprocity. Indirect reciprocity is
      a social interaction in which one actor helps another and is then benefited by a third party. Gossip has also been
      identified by Robin Dunbar, an evolutionary biologist, as aiding social bonding in large groups.<br><br>

      Gossip is often a pivotal part in the plot points of various media. Gossip begins the conflict, moves the story
      along, forms a climax and puts the resolution to an end. Shows like Mean Girls, Gossip Girls and Riverdale present
      gossip as a typical form of communications. Despite being so pivotal to continuing plots and often having a
      negative impact, the act of gossip itself is never treated as a bad thing. This lack of concern for the effects of
      gossip gives way to causing the act to be seen as unconcerning to participate in. To an extent this is true. As
      previously mentioned gossip allows for individuals who have no relation with each other to form a connection. Yeah
      the negative aspect of this is that this connection is based off of private information of another
      individual.<br><br>

      Evidence also demonstrates that gossip can allow for individuals to improve in certain elements of themselves. The
      information that is usually passed around in gossip can often be what others view negatively about an individual.
      Negative traits definitely are subjective, but when applying gossip it’s usually presumed that it has to be
      something that is viewed negatively as a norm. If an individual learns that gossip is formed due to a specific
      negative trait or action that they have or did, they may make attempts to better themselves.

      Even in social media, gossip is viewed as a trivial activity to participate in. Celebrities often go on Live
      Streaming services to either talk to one another or to their viewers about situations in their private lives that
      may concern another individual. TikTok challenges exist that promote spreading private information about a certain
      person or subject. It makes the activity appear glamorous and exciting. Social media influencers and content
      creators participate in activities such as “spilling tea” with several YouTube channels based on spreading gossip
      about individuals in certain communities. Such blatant lack of concern on the effects of gossip may be considered
      to have detrimental effects on the viewers especially if they’re young and impressionable. Their interpretation of
      it will be one where no type of concern is warranted toward the activity.<br><br>
