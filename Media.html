                  What is Gossip?
                </h1>

                <p style="color: ghostwhite;">
                  Gossip is idle talk or rumour, especially about the personal or private affairs of others; the act is also known as dishing or tattling.<br><br>

                  Gossip is a topic of research in evolutionary psychology, which has found gossip to be an important means for people to monitor cooperative reputations and so maintain widespread indirect reciprocity. Indirect reciprocity is a social interaction in which one actor helps another and is then benefited by a third party. Gossip has also been identified by Robin Dunbar, an evolutionary biologist, as aiding social bonding in large groups.
